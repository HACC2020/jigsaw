# Jigsaw
Team Jigsaw is comprised of students from the MIS 3050 course at Hawaii Pacific University. 

Our goal is to create a comprehensive electronic repository of available Sate support services, resources, and benefits as necessary for those needing assistance in these areas.  

This web application will incorporate programs and services from statewide government agencies and non-profit agencies in a user-friendly â€œone-stop-shop" directory making it easier for those needing support services and referrals.

Users of this application would initially be State employees who directly assist public (families and children) and are looking for appropriate support services/programs. The second phase of users would be expanded to the general public as a self-serving "one-stop-shop" platform.
